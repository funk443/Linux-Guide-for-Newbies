* 前言
** 為什麼你該使用Linux？
因為自由。

試想看看，你在安裝Windows的時候，微軟是不是強制要求你一定要使用一個微軟的帳號，即使你幾乎不使用它的服務。
抑或者，想要把預設的瀏覽器從Edge改成其它的瀏覽器，要一直被微軟試圖讓你繼續使用Edge的訊息疲勞轟炸？
還有在你玩遊戲玩得正開心的時候，突然幫你強制更新。

這些在Linux上都不會發生。
在Linux上，你想幹嘛就幹嘛（包括刪除你的整個作業系統）。
在Linux上，你不用辦一個微軟帳戶。
在Linux上，你想用什麼瀏覽器就用什麼瀏覽器。
在Linux上，你想什麼時候更新就什麼時候更新，甚至你不更新都行（不過這樣會對你的系統安全有負面影響）。

** 但是Linux很難不是嗎？
可能很多人對Linux的印象都是做什麼事情都需要打指令來完成。
這觀念在很久以前可能還是真的，不過近十年來，使用Linux幾乎已經變得跟使用Windows一樣簡單。

現在使用Linux，可能還是少數某些事情需要你使用指令來做，其餘大部份都有圖形化介面可以用。
你可能會說：「Ok，指令很難，這哪有跟Windows一樣簡單。」

但是你在Windows上去改一堆注冊表只為了把更新停掉或把工作列換個地方放有比較簡單嗎？
你就想想這個問題吧。

** 這份指南寫給誰？
寫給從未使用過Linux，但有興趣或想要嘗試看看的人。

* Linux的基本知識
在開始使用Linux前，我們不妨來了解一下Linux和一些常會使用到的名詞。如果你對此不感興趣可以直接跳到下一章。

** Linux到底是什麼？GNU/Linux又是什麼？
嚴格上來說，我們常說的「Linux」，並不是像Windows或是MacOS一樣的作業系統。
Linux實際上是一種系統核心（Kernel），它的工作簡單來說是把硬體的資源分配給電腦上其他軟體。
如果一個作業系統只單獨有核心本身，是沒有用途的。就像一台汽車只有引擎，而沒有變速箱等等其他東西是一樣的道理。

Linux核心會和一些其他軟體搭配成一個完整可用的Linux作業系統，而這些軟體通常來自GNU計劃。
所以大部份的Linux發行版可以被叫做「GNU/Linux」（唸作GNU slash linux），有些人偏好這種叫法（包括我），而有些人則覺得直接叫Linux會比較方便。
當然，有些發行版使用的並不是來自GNU的軟體（如Alpine Linux），因此就不會被稱為GNU/Linux。

** Linux發行版（Linux Distribution）
Linux發行版（Linux Distribution，或簡稱Linux Distro）就是我們廣義上說的Linux作業系統。

簡單來說，Linux發行版就是有別人把一個作業系統該有的軟體都打包好，變成一個安裝用的檔案給一般使用者安裝。
這樣一般人便可以不需要去接觸那些系統底層非常複雜的東西。
不過如果你想要的話，你也可以自己一步一步從Linux核心開始打造自己的作業系統，參考[[https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/][Linux from Scratch]]。

Linux發行版是讓Linux最與眾不同的地方，現今，有非常非常多種Linux發行版可以讓你選擇。
不管是正經的、奇怪的、簡單的還是困難的發行版你都找得到，總有一種適合你。
不同的發行版之間，差異最大的通常是套件管理系統。所以以下我就分幾個比較大的派系來簡介常見的幾個發行版。

*** Debian系（dpkg）
這些發行版通常採用dpkg這個套件管理員。
- Debian GNU/Linux\\
  是非常老的一個Linux發行版，現在很多發行版都是基於Debian修改的。
  它的特色是很「穩定」，也就是你不會很常需要更新你的系統或軟體。
  換句話說，在Debian上使用的軟體通常版本會比較舊一點點。

- Ubuntu\\
  是一個基於Debian的發行版，是使用者人數最多的發行版。
  之前很多人會推薦使用它來當入門Linux的第一個發行版，因為他簡單易用。
  不過最近幾年大部份人會推薦用下一個要介紹的Linux Mint，詳情可以看[[https://youtu.be/lr8iMnuW6aw][這部影片]]。
  
- Linux Mint\\
  一個基於Ubuntu的發行版，在最近幾年也是非常熱門的選擇。
  我自己用的第一個發行版就是Linux Mint，我可以保證，它真的很好用。
  在本文中的示範會用Linux Mint來完成。

- Pop!_OS\\
  也是一個基於Ubuntu的發行版，是近年來竄起的新星。
  這個發行版也蠻適合新手使用的，它好像是我第二個用的發行版。

*** Red Hat系（rpm）
這些發行版通常採用rpm這個套件管理員。
- Fedora\\
  也是一個熱門的發行版，連Linux核心的作者Linus也在用。

- OpenSUSE\\
  一個稍微沒有上面提到那些的發行版那麼熱門的發行版。
  也是一個對新手友善的發行版。

*** 其他
- Arch Linux\\
  還是一個熱門的Linux發行版，不過如果要使用它最好有一定的Linux經驗。
  很多人愛用它是因為它的軟體庫裡面的軟體數量多且更新快，和AUR。
  也是因此，你會需要常常更新你的系統，我以前用的時候是幾乎有事沒事就會檢查一下有沒有更新可用。
  *極度不推薦新手使用*

- Gentoo\\
  一個比Arch再進階一點的發行版。你需要自己編譯套件庫裡的軟體。

- Void Linux\\
  一個與眾不同的發行版，當別的發行版都採用SystemD來當起始系統的時候，它用runit。
  它是我現在用的發行版，我只能跟你說，我愛死它了。
  *如果你以後有了一定的Linux使用經驗後，請一定要試看看Void。*
  
** 桌面環境（Desktop Environment）和視窗管理員（Window Manager）
桌面環境是Linux日常使用中不可或缺的一部份。那什麼是桌面環境呢？

簡單來說，就是有人幫你整合一個日常使用的桌面所需要的一切軟體，包括但不限於後面會提到的視窗管理員、音效系統、系統面板和檔案管理員等等日常會用到的程式。
而Linux上有很多種桌面環境可以選擇，有長得像Windows的，有長得像MacOS的，也有有自己特色的，基本上每種桌面環境長得都不太一樣。
所以如果你覺得今天這個桌面環境看不順眼了，你隨時可以換到其他的桌面環境。
這也是用Linux的好處之一，那麼多桌面環境，總有一種你喜歡。更別提Linux上的桌面環境大多都可以高度自訂，變成你想要的樣子。

目前在Linux上有兩個主流的熱門桌面環境，KDE Plasma和GNOME，這些是大部份發行版預設使用的桌面環境。
其他還有一些比較不那麼吃系統資源的像是Xfce、MATE、LXQt和LXDE等等的桌面環境。
在Linux上，都可以依自己的喜好選擇。

接著我們講一下視窗管理員，它是用來管理你使用的程式的視窗的位置和外觀的程式。
緒如視窗的外框、放大縮小的按鈕等等都是視窗管理員管的。

通常視窗管理員都會搭配桌面環境來使用，不管有些人喜歡單純使用視窗管理員，這樣對系統資源的要求又會進一步降低。
不過缺點是使用者必須自己安裝其他必要的程式，像音效系統之類的等等，有點像你自己建造一個自己的桌面環境一樣。
所以通常是使用Linux有一定經驗的人才會單獨使用視窗管理員。

* 安裝Linux
有了一點背景知識，現在該來實作了。
你可以選擇要裝在Windows裡的虛擬機上，或是把硬碟騰出個空間，把它跟Windows裝在一起。

這裡會使用Linux Mint 21的Cinnamon桌面環境版來示範。
如果你有想要使用Linux Mint其他桌面環境版本的話或其他的發行版也行，安裝流程理論上來說是相似的。
假如你有發行版選擇困難的話，可以用[[https://distrochooser.de/][這個網站]]，來幫助你選擇。

** 需要準備的東西
- 一台電腦（不要用的舊電腦也行）
- 一個至少4GB的USB隨身碟（2GB好像也行，我不確定）

** 製作USB映像檔
1. 到[[https://linuxmint.com/download.php][Linux Mint的下載頁面]]，選擇Cinnamon Edition並按下Download按鈕。（當然你在這裡要選其他版本也是可以）
   [[./images/iso_1.png]]

2. 之後你會到像這樣的頁面，往下滑找台灣的節點下載即可。
   [[./images/iso_2.png]]

3. 接著下載[[https://rufus.ie/zh_TW/][Rufus]]，選擇可攜版即可。

4. 插上USB隨身碟，打開Rufus。介面應該長得如下圖。
   [[./images/iso_3.png]]

5. 在第一列裝置那裡，應該可以看到你要用的USB隨身碟，選擇它。

6. 接著按第二列的選擇，找到剛剛下載的iso檔案。

7. 按最下面的執行即可。 *注意！USB隨身碟裡所有資料都會被抹除*

** 進入Live USB
1. 確定把安裝要用的USB隨身碟準備好後，將電腦重新開機。

2. 參考這個網頁「Boot Menu」那列，在電腦開機時狂按對應按鍵來進入開機選單。（大部份是F12或Esc）

3. 接著你應該會看到類似的畫面，選擇你插進去的USB，大部份情況下選擇UEFI開頭的即可。
   以我這張圖為例，我就要選「UEFI: Sandisk, Partition 1」這個。
   如果在安裝上遇到問題，就選USB開頭的再裝一次試看看。
   [[./images/live_1.jpg]]

4. 選完按下Enter後，你應該會看到這個畫面，選擇第一項即可。
   [[./images/live_2.png]]

5. 接著你就進到Linux Mint了！
   [[./images/live_3.png]]

** 主要安裝流程
在進到Linux Mint的Live Environment後，你可以先四處看看，體驗一下，你在這個環境中做的變更都不會寫入到原本的USB中。
等你滿足完你的好奇心後，就可以點桌面上那個「Install Linux Mint」的光碟圖示開始安裝了。
1. 點擊兩下桌面上的光碟圖示後，可以在跳出來的這個畫面選取你想要的系統語言。
   在這裡，我選擇繁體中文。
   [[./images/install_1.png]]

2. 接著下一步，選擇鍵盤的配置。如果你在上一步選的語言是中文的話，那麼它在這裡預設會給你Chinese的鍵盤配置。
   不過我建議往下滑一點，使用「English (US)」的配置。
   [[./images/install_2.png]]

3. 接下來，勾選這個框框。
   [[./images/install_3.png]]

4. 如果你的電腦還有安裝其他系統，那麼這邊他會出現「將Linux Mint和XXX裝在一起的選項」。
   如果你還想保留其他系統，就選擇那個選項。或你想直接把之前的系統抹掉，就選「清除磁碟並安裝Linux Mint」。
   當然你如果知道磁碟應該要怎麼分割的話就選最後一項。
   [[./images/install_4.png]]

5. 這裡我假設你還想要保留Windows，所以我選第一個選項。
   選下去後，它會問你空間要怎麼配。可以用中間那條線來分配大小。
   左邊的「檔案」部份是你可以跟Windows一起存取的部份，而右邊的「Linux Mint」部份則是Linux專屬的檔案分區，Windows沒辦法存取。
   *注意！請確定你有把Windows裡重要的檔案備份，有時候它可能會不小心洗掉你Windows中的檔案*
   [[./images/install_5.png]]

6. 在按下立即安裝後，應該會有兩個小視窗跳出來，閱讀之後覺得可以就下一步吧。
   接下來，他會要你選擇時區。
   [[./images/install_6.png]]

7. 選好後，就要建立你的使用者帳號了。
   除了你的名稱外，其餘的格子最好不要含空格，用減號（-）來代替空格。
   將家目錄加密一般來說是不用勾選。
   [[./images/install_7.png]]

8. 按下繼續後，系統就會開始安裝了。
   [[./images/install_8.png]]

9. 等它跑完後，會跳出你要繼續用這個Live USB環境還是重開機。
   所有你在Live USB做的變更都會消失。
   這裡我直接選重開機。
   [[./images/install_9.png]]

10. 之後它會出現這個畫面，這時把你的USB隨身碟拔掉後，按下Enter即可。
    [[./images/install_10.png]]

恭喜你，你成功在電腦上安裝好Linux了！

之後每次開機應該都會像這樣的選單，如果你要使用Windows的話在這裡選擇即可。
[[./images/install_11.png]]

     <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

11. RELICENSING

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
